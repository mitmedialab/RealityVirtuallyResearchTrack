I suggest we change the timing of the research session from 9-2 to 9-4 The timing change is suggested because I predict it may not be worthwhile to close out research activities at 2pm for people who come to the event in order to participate in research activities. It usually takes an hour for lunch at an event where people want to talk to one another and ending the event without an afternoon session following lunch would be quite a waste - unless there was some important reason to do so. For a research session happening as part of a hackathon, ending the research session before judges announce hackathon winners is important. I don't know much about the expo but it does not sound like something that should necessarily cause a research event to terminate early. 

I suppose it would be perfectly fine if the research session ended at 4pm but some participants in the session choose to wonder off at/after 2pm and check out the expo so long as they were not slated to present. In that case, I assume they would need to be registered for the expo and the hackathon and perhaps pay fees or charges associated with that. There is currently no need for a hard budget for anything related to the research activity and I see no need to charge researchers or others who register to participate solely in that activity. But space is always a premium, so participation would be of value I assume.

I suggest we change the title from research "conference" to research "unconference". The change of title for this session from "conference" to "unconference" is because unconference conotes a more innovative format consistent with self-organizing and less formal meeting formats. These formats require much less up front planning, administration and management resources and are far simpler/easier to actually host and conduct when they happen. By using the type of Google form driven sessions candidates and final selections (whether lightning talk or demo presentations) paired with self-organizing small group discussions among the research event participants who are interested in that topic, it is possible to create a surprisingly high quality research and innovation oriented event. While less formal, the value created and experience provided can still be great due to how this particular meeting format is designed. 

I hasten to add - if a more formal, coordinated and managed "research conference" is what is needed then that is what should happen. In that case, I'd just need to hand-off the materials and arrangements developed so far to whomever would be responsible for the research conference. I'd be happy to help make updates and transfer accounts, etc. Although a formal/typical style conference event is beyond what I can be fully or partly responsible for, I would help out in some way with getting the word out and/or day of the event. There are not a lot of arrangements or materials to hand off at this point, but if there is to be any major change in format or approach, it would need to be decided by the end of July so that I can plan appropriately, not waste time and ensure a successful research session occurs when the day comes.

It is really up to others to decide, but instead of a formal conference format, I'd like to invite consideration of some potential advantages of the different style of format I've suggested . I'm suggesting a variation of what is known as the "open space" unconference meeting format because I've observed the mix of structure and self-organization provides all participants the opportunity to hear many different new ideas (from the quick talks or demos) and to experience a few discussions (based on the presenters and topics of their choosing). The big group touchpoints (at the start, at lunch and at the end) along with the presentations and small group discussions is a pretty reliable way to generate lots of good experiences and catalyzing idea-flow among different combinations of people interested in the same topics. In my opinion, these are attributes of a good research session and especially appropriate to a VR/AR hackathon special session at the Media Lab. 

FWIW, there is something about this format that appears unusually efficient/effective at resulting in good event outcomes. I think this is partly because the meeting format helps to optimize matches/mixes of people+ideas+experiences and when the format is well facilitated the people generally report feeling good about their experience, what they learned, who they met, etc. There are also more tangible outputs from such research events that are of good value despite not being the result of heavy duty wrangling/editing/curating papers, presentations, discussion notes, etc. I'm suggesting a tweak on the typical process for Open Space that funnels presentation proposals through Google Forms and uses Google slides for presentations which can provide some cool new ways to collaborate and produce easy to access/collect/curate meeting outputs with low coordination costs.

Last thing about the suggestion for basically running the entire research session on Google forms and slides: A unified slide deck or an event is a good idea in general but Google Slides are an uncanny good fit for this format. Assuming a ground rule is that any presenter using slides is expected to use Google Slides, then the authoritative slide deck can easily contain the final version of each presenters slides and they can even change their slides up to the last moment or while they are presenting! For presenters doing a demo, at least the splash page for their presentation is on a slide in the right order and with the right speaker/title/etc info. The special sauce a second corollary rule that all small group discussion notes likewise will be added on additional "notes" slides inserted (as many as needed) at the end of the same Google Slides deck used for the lightning talk or demo The result of funnelling everything through Google forms and slides is that all the general event content (the final agenda, the intro/outro stuff, branding, thanks/attributions, etc, etc) and all the presentation/demo content (the speaker names/affiliations, presentation titles, actual slide content, links/references, bio's etc, etc) and all the breakout group/discussion content (who led the session, notes of the main comments/questions/ideas/etc, outline/snippets of code or other examples people discussed, links to relevant projects/posts/people/etc, photos of whiteboards, etc) are instantly available the moment entered onto one of the event slide decks by any presenter, participant or other invited contributor. This means that 1. this provides everything needed for a nice, complete proceedings and with a little low intensity wrangling it is suitable as on output from the event and 2. it is real-time so anybody involved with the event can see what any other small group is up to at the same time and this is cool to see for organizers, participants (who talked about what just now?) and others at the event or beyond.
